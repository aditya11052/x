   Our Mission is to provide the consumer with the best product possible. <br>
   When we first created X Tech we had a dream. A Dream to one day be <br>
   in the same market as Apple and Samsung. Today we're able to look back <br>
   at our past selves and smile. Who would've thought 3 Princeton Graduates <br>
   would be able to stand next to Apple, Samsung and Microsoft. <br>
   We couldn't have done any of this without you, the people. <br>
   Every day YOU are the reason we work hard. YOU are the reason <br>
   we work longer and harder hours. Because at the end of the day <br>
   knowing we'll change lives makes everything worth it.

    X Technologies was founded by Mike Robite, Esdi Kard and Aditya Mota. <br>
    The Three Boys met at Princeton University. The Three were roommates <br>
    for all 4 years at the school. When the 3 Graduated in 2010 they <br>
    moved into an apartment near the University where they developed the <br>
    first prototype for the XFONE. After a successful pitch on Shark Tank <br>
    the three boys recieved a deal from Mark Cuban and Mr. Wonderful himself <br>
    Kevin O'Leary. Cuban and O'Leary manufactured the devices while the three <br>
    focused on developing the devices. After the successful release of the XFONE <br>
    Cuban and O'Leary threw a huge party for them in Ceasers Palace, Las Vegas <br>
    and the rest is history.
